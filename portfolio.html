                <a>Smart car parking system</a>
                 <p class="text">
                    The car parking system using Arduino is an innovative solution for efficiently managing parking spaces in a given area. The system uses Arduino microcontroller board and sensors to detect the presence or absence of a car in a parking spot. The sensors communicate with the microcontroller, which processes the information and sends signals to a display unit to indicate the status of each parking spot. The sys- tem is designed to be user-friendly and convenient, allowing drivers to quickly locate available parking spots without having to drive around the parking lot. The system can also be customized to include features such as automated payment and reservation systems.
